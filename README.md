# Simple Defect Detector

## Overview
Product defect detection can be easy.

This repo shows how to fine-tune a ResNet-18 model to identify product defects. The included dataset is of cast submersible pump impellers, but other datasets can easily be dropped in, and the model finetuned on those instead.

Vanilla PyTorch is used and the training script is super simple.
